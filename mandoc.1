.Op Fl W Ns Ar err...

.\" SECTION
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility formats a BSD 
.Dq mdoc 
manual page for display.  The arguments are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width XXXXXXXXXXXX
.\" ITEM
.It Fl f Ns Ar option...
Override default compiler behaviour.  See 
.Sx Compiler Options
for details.
.\" ITEM
.It Fl T
Output format.  See
.Sx Output Formats
for available formats.  Defaults to
.Fl T Ns Ar ascii .
.\" ITEM
.It Fl V
Print version and exit.
.\" ITEM
.It Fl W Ns Ar err...
Print warning messages.  May be set to 
.Fl W Ns Ar all
for all warnings, 
.Ar compat
for groff/troff-compatibility warnings, or
.Ar syntax
for syntax warnings.  If
.Fl W Ns Ar error 
is specified, warnings are considered errors and cause utility
termination.  Multiple 
.Fl W
arguments may be comma-separated, such as
.Fl W Ns Ar error,all .
.\" ITEM
.It Ar infile...
Read input from zero or more
.Ar infile .
If unspecified, reads from stdin.  If multiple files are specified,
.Nm
will halt with the first failed parse.
.El
.\" PARAGRAPH
.Pp
By default, 
.Nm 
reads from stdin and prints 78-column backspace-encoded output to stdout
as if
.Fl T Ns Ar ascii
were provided.

.Ss Reserved Words
The reserved words described in
.Xr mdoc 7
are handled according to the following rules:
.Bl -enum -offset XXX
.It
Opening delimiters 
.Po
.Sq \&( , 
.Sq \&[ , 
and
.Sq \&{
.Pc are not followed by whitespace.
.It
Closing delimiters
.Po
.Sq \&. , 
.Sq \&, , 
.Sq \&; , 
.Sq \&: , 
.Sq \&? , 
.Sq \&! , 
.Sq \&) , 
.Sq \&] 
and
.Sq \&}
.Pc are not preceeded by whitespace.
.El
.\" PARAGRAPH
.Pp
Note that reserved words may occur in streams of text, so the following:
.Bd -literal -offset XXXX
this self is not that of the waking , empirically real man
.Ed
.\" PARAGRAPH
.Pp
\&...correctly adjusts the comma spacing to
.Qq this self is not that of the waking , empirically real man .
.\" SUB-SECTION
.Ss Output Formats
The
.Nm
utility accepts the following
.Fl T
arguments:
.Bl -tag -width XXXXXXXXXXXX -offset XXXX
.It Ar ascii
Produce 7-bit ASCII output, backspace-encoded for bold and underline
styles.  This is the default.
.It Ar tree
Produce an indented parse tree.
.It Ar lint
Parse only: produce no output.
.El
.\" SUB-SECTION
.Ss Compiler Options
Default compiler behaviour may be overriden with the
.Fl f
flag.
.Bl -tag -width XXXXXXXXXXXX -offset XXXX
.It Fl f Ns Ar ign-scope
When rewinding the scope of a block macro, forces the compiler to ignore
scope violations.  This can seriously mangle the resulting tree.
.It Fl f Ns Ar ign-escape
Ignore invalid escape sequences.
.It Fl f Ns Ar ign-macro
Ignore unknown macros at the start of input lines.
.El
.\" PARAGRAPH
.Pp
As with the
.Fl W
flag, multiple
.Fl f
options may be grouped and delimited with a comma.  Using
.Fl f Ns Ar ign-scope,ign-escape ,
for example, will try to ignore scope and character-escape errors.

.Sh CAVEATS
The 
.Nm
utility in
.Fl T Ns Ar ascii
mode doesn't yet know how to display the following:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
The \-hang 
.Sq \&Bl
list is not yet supported.
.\" LIST-ITEM
.It
The \-literal and \-unfilled 
.Sq \&Bd
displays types are synonyms, as are \-filled and \-ragged.
.\" LIST-ITEM
.It
The
.Sq \&Xo/Xc
pair isn't supported.
.\" LIST-ITEM
.It
The
.Sq \&Bd
macro doesn't process \-compact .
.El
.Pp
Other macros still aren't supported by virtue of nobody complaining
about their absence.  Please report any omissions: this is a work in
progress.
