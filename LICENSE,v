@Modernization, no functional change intended:
Use the POSIX function getline(3) rather than the slightly
dangerous BSD function fgetln(3).
Remove the related compatibility code.

@Finally use __progname, err(3) and warn(3).
That's more readable and less error-prone than fumbling around
with argv[0], fprintf(3), strerror(3), perror(3), and exit(3).

It's a bad idea to boycott good interfaces merely because standards
committees ignore them.  Instead, let's provide compatibility modules
for archaic systems (like commercial Solaris) that still don't have
them.  The compat module has an UCB Copyright (c) 1993...

@Provide a fallback version of fts(3) for systems lacking it.
I chose the OpenBSD version because it apparently contains various
bugfixes that never made it into libnbcompat.  To reduce size and
complexity, i stripped out the features we don't need.
