@Improve build system and autodetection.
* Make ./configure standalone, that's what people expect.
* Let people write a ./configure.local from scratch, not edit existing files.
* Autodetect wchar, sqlite3, and manpath and act accordingly.
* Autodetect the need for -L/usr/local/lib and -lutil.
* Get rid of config.h.p{re,ost}, let ./configure only write what's needed.
* Let ./configure write a Makefile.local snippet, that's quite flexible.

@Get rid of HAVE_CONFIG_H, it is always defined; idea from libnbcompat.
Include <sys/types.h> where needed, it does not belong in config.h.
Remove <stdio.h> from config.h; if it is missing somewhere, it should
be added, but i cannot find a *.c file where it is missing.

@Scary-looking but otherwise harmless changes allow me to build for Windows.
That is to say, with mingw32.  This amounts to the following:

 (1) break compat.c into compat_strlcpy.c and compat_strlcat.c
 (2) add compat_getsubopt.c (from OpenBSD) and test-getsubopt.c
 (3) add test-strptime.c for HAVE_STRPTIME
 (4) add ifdef bits here and there, where necessary
 (5) remove some harmless unportable stuff (u_char, localtime_r)

I've added the appropriate mdocml.zip target to the Makefile, too.
