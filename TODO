- explicit blocks with missing end macro should be implicitely closed
  at the end of the enclosing block, e.g. .Bl It (El) Sh

- fix bad block nesting involving multiple identical explicit blocks
  see the OpenBSD mdoc_macro.c 1.47 commit message

- .Bl -column .Xo support is missing
  ultimate goal:
  restore .Xr and .Dv to
  lib/libc/compat-43/sigvec.3
  lib/libc/gen/signal.3
  lib/libc/sys/sigaction.2

- edge case: decide how to deal with blk_full bad nesting, e.g.
  .Sh .Nm .Bk .Nm .Ek .Sh found by jmc@ in ssh-keygen(1)

- auto-Bk in the SYNOPSIS
  patch from kristaps@  Fri, 16 Jul 2010 14:51:24 +0200
  to be revisited after OpenBSD 4.8 tree unlock

- implement \\
  in plain text, identical to \e
  as a macro argument, identical to \ i.e. escaping the next character
  We do not have macro definitions yet; if we implement them,
  \\ must behave in a macro def like in a macro argument,
  and when using the macro, it must expand yet again.

- look at bsd.lv tbl(1)

  also look at the mail from Thomas Klausner wiz at NetBSD
    on Wed, 2 Jun 2010 11:01:29 +0200

- look at pages generated from reStructeredText, e.g. devel/mercurial hg(1)
  These are a weird mixture of man(7) and custom autogenerated low-level
  roff stuff.  Figure out to what extent we can cope.

- implement blank `Bl -column', such as
  .Bl -column
  .It foo Ta bar
  .El

- explicitly disallow nested `Bl -column', which would clobber internal
  flags defined for struct mdoc_macro

- set a meaningful default if no `Bl' list type is assigned

- have a blank `It' head for `Bl -tag' not puke

- prohibit `Nm' from having non-text HEAD children
  (e.g., NetBSD mDNSShared/dns-sd.1)
  (mdoc_html.c and mdoc_term.c `Nm' handlers can be slightly simplified)

* formatting issues: ugly output
************************************************************************

- perl(1) SYNOPSIS looks bad; reported by deraadt@
  1) man(7) seems to need SYNOPSIS .Nm blocks, too

- empty phrases in .Bl column produce too few blanks
  try e.g. .Bl -column It Ta Ta

- .Pp before and after .Sh (and .Ss) produces a spurious blank line;

************************************************************************
* formatting issues: gratuitious differences
************************************************************************

- none reported right now (yet schwarze@ knows of some)

************************************************************************
* performance issues
************************************************************************

Several areas can be cleaned up to make mandoc even faster.  These are 

- improve hashing mechanism for macros (quite important: performance)

- improve hashing mechanism for characters (not as important)

************************************************************************
* structural issues
