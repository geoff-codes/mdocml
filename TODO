- explicit blocks with missing end macro should be implicitely closed
  at the end of the enclosing block, e.g. .Bl It (El) Sh

- fix bad block nesting involving multiple identical explicit blocks
  see the OpenBSD mdoc_macro.c 1.47 commit message

- .Bl -column .Xo support is missing
  ultimate goal:
  restore .Xr and .Dv to
  lib/libc/compat-43/sigvec.3
  lib/libc/gen/signal.3
  lib/libc/sys/sigaction.2

- implement \\
  in plain text, identical to \e
  as a macro argument, identical to \ i.e. escaping the next character
  We do not have macro definitions yet; if we implement them,
  \\ must behave in a macro def like in a macro argument,
  and when using the macro, it must expand yet again.

- implement \s (physical font size)
  \sN - set to N
  \s+N - increment by N, 1 <= N <= 8
  \s-N - decrement by N, 1 <= N <= 8
  \s0 - restore previous size
  \s(nn \s+-(nn \s'+-nn' \s+-'nn' \s[+-nn] \s+-[nn] - disambiguate
  registers: .s .ps .sr .psr
  used by e.g. cu(1), tip(1)

- look at bsd.lv tbl(1)

  also look at the mail from Thomas Klausner wiz at NetBSD
    on Wed, 2 Jun 2010 11:01:29 +0200

- look at pages generated from reStructeredText, e.g. devel/mercurial hg(1)
  These are a weird mixture of man(7) and custom autogenerated low-level
  roff stuff.  Figure out to what extent we can cope.

- implement blank `Bl -column', such as
  .Bl -column
  .It foo Ta bar
  .El

- explicitly disallow nested `Bl -column', which would clobber internal
  flags defined for struct mdoc_macro

- set a meaningful default if no `Bl' list type is assigned

- have a blank `It' head for `Bl -tag' not puke

- ignore horrendous m[] font colouring
  reported by J.C. Roberts

- prohibit `Nm' from having non-text HEAD children
  (e.g., NetBSD mDNSShared/dns-sd.1)
  (mdoc_html.c and mdoc_term.c `Nm' handlers can be slightly simplified)
  
************************************************************************
* formatting issues: ugly output
************************************************************************

- outside list context, text following .Sm off
  seems to follow without a blank (TERM_NOBLANK reset late?) e.g.
        .Sm off
        .Xo
        .Op Ar bind_address No /
        .Ar port
        .Xc
        .Sm on
        or by enclosing

- empty phrases in .Bl column produce too few blanks
  try e.g. .Bl -column It Ta Ta

************************************************************************
* formatting issues: gratuitious differences
************************************************************************

- none reported right now (yet schwarze@ knows of some)

************************************************************************
* performance issues
************************************************************************

Several areas can be cleaned up to make mandoc even faster.  These are 

- improve hashing mechanism for macros (quite important: performance)

- improve hashing mechanism for characters (not as important)

************************************************************************
* structural issues
************************************************************************

- The regs.h functionality and the roff_getstrn() family should be moved
  into mandoc.c, which should be accessable by libroff, libmdoc, and
  libman.  Right now there's pollution between these libraries.
