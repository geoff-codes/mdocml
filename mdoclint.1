.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm mdoclint
.Op Fl vV
.Op Fl f Ns Ar options...
.Op Fl W Ns Ar err...
.Op Ar infile...
.\" SECTION
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility parses a BSD 
.Dq mdoc 
manual pages and validates its syntax tree.  The arguments are as
follows:
.Bl -tag -width XXXXXXXXXXXX -offset XXXX
.\" ITEM
.It Fl v
Print verbose parsing output.
.\" ITEM
.It Fl V
Print version and exit.
.\" ITEM
.It Fl f Ns Ar option...
Override default compiler behaviour.  See 
.Sx Compiler Options
for details.
.\" ITEM
.It Fl W Ns Ar err...
Print warning messages.  May be set to 
.Fl W Ns Ar all
for all warnings, 
.Ar compat
for groff/troff-compatibility warnings, or
.Ar syntax
for syntax warnings.  If
.Fl W Ns Ar error 
is specified, warnings are considered errors and cause utility
termination.  Multiple 
.Fl W
arguments may be comma-separated, such as
.Fl W Ns Ar error,all .
.\" ITEM
.It Ar infile
Read input from
.Ar infile ,
which may be 
.Dq \-
for stdin.  If multiple 
.Ar infile
arguments are specified, each is processed and the system will exit on
the first failure.
.El
.\" PARAGRAPH
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility is a front-end for
.Xr mdoc 3 ,
which parses the 
.Dq mdoc
input, documented at
.Xr mdoc 7
and
.Xr mdoc.samples 7 ,
into an abstract syntax tree.  By default, it reads from stdin.
.\" PARAGRAPH

.Ex -std mdoclint
.\" SUB-SECTION
.Ss Compiler Options
Default compiler behaviour may be overriden with the
.Fl f
flag.  The available options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width XXXXXXXXXXXX -offset XXXX
.It Fl f Ns Ar ign-scope
When rewinding the scope of a block macro, forces the compiler to ignore
scope violations.  This can seriously mangle the resulting tree.
.It Fl f Ns Ar ign-escape
Ignore invalid escape sequences.
.It Fl f Ns Ar ign-macro
Ignore unknown macros at the start of input lines.
.El
.\" PARAGRAPH
.Pp
As with the
.Fl W
flag, multiple
.Fl f
options may be grouped and delimited with a comma.  Using
.Fl f Ns Ar ign-scope,ign-escape ,
for example, will try to ignore scope and character-escape errors.
.\" SUB-SECTION
.Ss Input Encoding
The
.Nm
utility expects its input to be 7-bit ASCII as defined in
.Xr ascii 7 .
The only non-graphing characters accepted are spaces,
.Sq \  ,
and tabs,
.Sq \et .
Tabs are only accepted in literal block-displays and as column
delimiters.
.Pp
Only Unix-style newlines (\en) are accepted; if the newline is escaped,
the line is concatenated with the next.
