@Some presentation polish in man.cgi:

 - include search bar above result page (I relent: it's annoying to
   follow three links then press back three times to get a search page);
 - make man.cgi.css into man-cgi.css so Apache isn't confused by two
   handlers (css, cgi);
 - finally consolidate example.style.css to be under the div.mandoc css
   selector;
 - put catman pages under div.catman;
 - put search bar under div#mancgi;
 - reflect this properly in the bundled CSS files.

@Add skeleton man.cgi.css file.  I don't think this should become more
complicated than this.  Also make the title be printed out in caps as it
is in apropos(1) and whatis(1).
