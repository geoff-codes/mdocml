log
@Modernization, no functional change intended:
Use the POSIX function getline(3) rather than the slightly
dangerous BSD function fgetln(3).
Remove the related compatibility code.

@Improve build system and autodetection.
* Make ./configure standalone, that's what people expect.
* Let people write a ./configure.local from scratch, not edit existing files.
* Autodetect wchar, sqlite3, and manpath and act accordingly.
* Autodetect the need for -L/usr/local/lib and -lutil.
* Get rid of config.h.p{re,ost}, let ./configure only write what's needed.
* Let ./configure write a Makefile.local snippet, that's quite flexible.

@Get rid of HAVE_CONFIG_H, it is always defined; idea from libnbcompat.
Include <sys/types.h> where needed, it does not belong in config.h.
Remove <stdio.h> from config.h; if it is missing somewhere, it should
be added, but i cannot find a *.c file where it is missing.

1.1
log
@Compatibility support fgetln() on Linux.  This uses the BSD-licensed
implementation from NetBSD tnftpd, Christos Zoulas (copyright message
retained in the compat_fgetln.c file).  Patch verified by schwarze@@.  He
notes that you'll need -pthread for -static binaries (due to libdb), so
I've noted that -static should really only be used for BSD UNIX.

While here, add some forgotten goop to the Makefile, building and
cleaning extra manpages.
