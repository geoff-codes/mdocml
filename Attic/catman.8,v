@Remove catman(8): it's superfluous.
Users of man.cgi should be able to just copy in their directories and have
the CGI fine everything on its own or just suck it up or, in the cases
of multiple manroots, have a simple config file.
Besides, now that mandocdb(8) is using relative paths for everything,
needing a fancy "cp -R" is silly.

.Dt CATMAN 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm catman
.Nd update a man.cgi manpage cache
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm catman
.Op Fl fv
.Op Fl C Ar file
.Op Fl M Ar manpath
.Op Fl m Ar manpath
.Op Fl o Ar path
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility updates cached manpages for a jailed
.Xr man.cgi 7 .
.Pp
By default,
.Nm
searches for
.Xr mandocdb 8
databases in the default paths stipulated by
.Xr man 1
and updates the cache in
.Pa /var/www/cache/man.cgi .
.Pp
Its arguments are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl f
Force an update to all files.
.It Fl v
Print each file being updated.
.It Fl C Ar file
Specify an alternative configuration
.Ar file
in
.Xr man.conf 5
format.
.It Fl M Ar manpath
Use the colon-separated path instead of the default list of paths
searched for
.Xr mandocdb 8
databases.
Invalid paths, or paths without manual databases, are ignored.
.It Fl m Ar manpath
Prepend the colon-separated paths to the list of paths searched
for
.Xr mandocdb 8
databases.
Invalid paths, or paths without manual databases, are ignored.
.It Fl o Ar path
Update into the directory tree under
.Ar path .
.El
.Pp
Cache updates occur when a
.Xr mandocdb 8
database is older than the cached copy unless
.Fl f
is specified, in which case files are always considered out of date.
Cached manual pages are only updated if older than the master copy.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ev MANPATH
Colon-separated paths modifying the default list of paths searched for
manual databases.
Invalid paths, or paths without manual databases, are ignored.
Overridden by
.Fl M .
If
.Ev MANPATH
begins with a
.Sq \&: ,
it is appended to the default list;
else if it ends with
.Sq \&: ,
it is prepended to the default list; else if it contains
.Sq \&:: ,
the default list is inserted between the colons.
If none of these conditions are met, it overrides the default list.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std

@Remove the old man.cgi.
Running that would not be a responsible thing to do, nowadays.

1.4
log
@Support leading, trailing and double colons in MANPATH to prepend,
append or insert the man.conf(5) default path; compatible with GNU
manpath(1), implementation by kristaps@@, heavily tweaked by schwarze@@.

Updates to MANPATH documentation applied to whatis.1, apropos.1, and
catman.8 also.

@Make catman and man.cgi understand the index type-field.
Also make catman's man.conf be generated as catman.conf to avoid clobbering
a real man.conf file.
Finally, add a placeholder catman() function to man.cgi for preformatted
manuals in the cache.
