@Make apropos's lookup use a find(1)-like expression.  I'll write more on
this when it completes; this is to keep it in-tree.

Right now this uses prefix notation.  Ignore it.  I'll make this into
infix notation real soon.

The goal of this (exprcomp and exprexec) is to have arbitrary logical
expressions.

@Split apropos.c into db.c and apropos.h with simpler code (re-written, but
inspired by apropos.c and mandoc-tools' mandoc-cgi.c).  This uses UTF-8
right now for its re-writing, but will soon accomodate for the regular
suspects (this is a rather simple matter).

I also introduce man.cgi (cgi.c), which is a standalone CGI that replaces
mandoc-tools' mandoc.cgi.  Right now it's just a framework.
