.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm mdocml
.Op Fl vW
.Op Fl f Ar filter
.Op Fl o Ar outfile
.Op Ar infile
.\"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility parses mdoc formatted manual source and passes results into an
output filter.  The current output filters are
.Ar html
and
.Ar xml ,
the default.  Arguments common to all filters follow:
.Bl -tag -width "\-o outfile"
.It Fl f Ar filter
The output filter name.
.It Fl o Ar outfile
Write output to 
.Ar outfile ,
which may be
.Qq \-
for stdout.
.It Fl W
Print warnings to stderr.
.It Ar infile
Read input from
.Ar infile ,
which may be 
.Qq \-
for stdin.
.El
.Pp
By default,
.Nm
reads from stdin and writes to stdout using the xml filter.
.Pp
.Ex -std mdocml

.Ss XML Filter
The XML filter, specified by
.Fl f Ar xml ,
is the default filter.  This filter has no additional arguments.
.Pp
The XML filter creates an XML document where element names are their respective
roff macro names.  Each element name has an associated
namespace, which is one of 
.Qq block ,
.Qq head ,
.Qq body ,
or
.Qq inline ,
corresponding to the display mode of a node.  The document root is
always the
.Qq mdoc
element, in the default namespace; the 
.Qq head
namespace is for block headers (such as 
.Sq .Ss
and
.Sq .Sh ) ;
the
.Qq body
namespace is for block bodies; and the
.Qq inline
namespace is for in-line elements (such as
.Sq .Em ) .
.Ss HTML Filter
The HTML filter, specified by
.Fl f Ar html ,
accepts the following filter-specific arguments:
.Bl -tag -width "\-c css"
.It Fl c Ar css
The CSS file location, which defaults to 
.Ar mdocml.css .
.It Fl e
Whether to embed the CSS file into the HTML prologue.
.El

.Sh EXAMPLES
To produce an HTML4-strict document 
.Pa mdocml.html
for
.Pa mdocml.1 
with the default, embedded style-sheet:
.Pp
.D1 % mdocml -fhtml -e -o mdocml.html mdocml.1 
.Pp
To create an XML document on standard output from
.Pa mdocml.1
with the default namespace identifiers
.Li head ,
.Li body ,
.Li block 
and
.Li inline :
.Pp
.D1 % mdocml mdocml.1

.Sh CAVEATS
Most caveats of
.Nm
stem from ambiguities in 
.Xr mdoc 7
or the necessary limitations of converting an ad hoc language into
structured ones:
.Bl -enum -compact -offset indent
.It 
The engine doesn't understand the
.Sq \&No ,
.Sq \&Db ,
.Sq \&Xc ,
and
.Sq \&Xo
mdoc macros.
.It 
All macro arguments may be quoted, instead of only some.
.It 
Blank lines raise errors.
.It 
If terminating punctuation is found, then 
.Em all
remaining tokens are flushed after line scope is closed, not just the
last one.
.El
.Pp
The roff engine in 
.Nm
produces text in-line; thus, output may already be partially written by
the time an error is encountered.
