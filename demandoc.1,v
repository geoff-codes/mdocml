.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm demandoc
.Nd emit only text of UNIX manuals
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm demandoc
.Op Fl w
.Op Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility emits only the text portions of well-formed
.Xr mdoc 7
and
.Xr man 7
.Ux
manual files.
.Pp
By default,
.Nm
parses standard input and outputs only text nodes, preserving line
and column position.
Escape sequences are omitted from the output.
.Pp
Its arguments are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl w
Output a word list.
This outputs each word of text on its own line.
A
.Qq word ,
in this case, refers to whitespace-delimited terms beginning with at
least two letters and not consisting of any escape sequences.
Words have their leading and trailing punctuation
.Pq double-quotes, sentence punctuation, etc.
stripped.
.It Ar
The input files.
.El
.Pp
If a document is not well-formed, it is skipped.
.Pp
The
.Fl i ,
.Fl k ,
.Fl m ,
and
.Fl p
flags are silently discarded for calling compatibility with the
historical deroff.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm
utility exits with one of the following values:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It 0
No errors occurred.
.It 6
An operating system error occurred, for example memory exhaustion or an
error accessing input files.
Such errors cause
.Nm
to exit at once, possibly in the middle of parsing or formatting a file.
The output databases are corrupt and should be removed .
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The traditional usage of
.Nm
is for spell-checking manuals on
.Bx .
This is accomplished as follows (assuming British spelling):
.Pp
.Dl $ demandoc -w file.1 | spell -b
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr mandoc 1 ,
.Xr man 7 ,
.Xr mdoc 7
.Sh HISTORY
.Nm
replaces the historical deroff utility for handling modern
.Xr man 7
and
.Xr mdoc 7
documents.
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
utility was written by
.An Kristaps Dzonsons Aq Mt kristaps@@bsd.lv .

@Finishing touches on demandoc.  It now backs over ending punctuation as
well as leading punctuation.  Again, this isn't the same as deroff
(which uses, I think, some punctuation as delimiters), but it's easier
to explain and simpler to audit.

@Make `-w' mode work much better.  This is INCREDIBLY poorly specified in
any other deroff manual, and as I don't think anybody actually uses
deroff, I don't feel compelled to research its behaviour too much and
can just do what's logical.
