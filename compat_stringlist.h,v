@In private header files, __BEGIN_DECLS and __END_DECLS are pointless.
Because these work slightly differently on different systems,
they are becoming a maintenance burden in the portable version,
so delete them.

Besides, one of the chief design goals of the mandoc toolbox is to
make sure that nothing related to documentation requires C++.
Consequently, linking mandoc against any kind of C++ program would
defeat the purpose and is not supported.
I don't understand why kristaps@@ added them in the first place.

@Remove clauses 3 and 4 from Christos Zoulas' BSD license.
This is safe because Christos did that himself in NetBSD in 2008.
No code change.
