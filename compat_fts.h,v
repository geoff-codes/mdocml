log
@In private header files, __BEGIN_DECLS and __END_DECLS are pointless.
Because these work slightly differently on different systems,
they are becoming a maintenance burden in the portable version,
so delete them.

Besides, one of the chief design goals of the mandoc toolbox is to
make sure that nothing related to documentation requires C++.
Consequently, linking mandoc against any kind of C++ program would
defeat the purpose and is not supported.
I don't understand why kristaps@@ added them in the first place.

log
@We always use FTS_NOCHDIR, so delete the directory changing code.
This not only simplifies matters, but also helps operating systems
lacking dirfd(3), for example Solaris 10.  Solaris dirfd issue
reported by Sevan Janiyan <venture37 at geeklan dot co dot uk>.

1.1
log
@Provide a fallback version of fts(3) for systems lacking it.
I chose the OpenBSD version because it apparently contains various
bugfixes that never made it into libnbcompat.  To reduce size and
complexity, i stripped out the features we don't need.
