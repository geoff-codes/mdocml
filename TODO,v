************************************************************************

Many issues are annotated for difficulty as follows:

 - loc = locality of the issue
    *    single file issue, affects file only, or very few
    **   single module issue, affects several files of one module
    ***  cross-module issue, significantly impacts multiple modules
         and may require substantial changes to internal interfaces
 - exist = difficulty of the existing code in this area
    *    affected code is straightforward and easy to read and change
    **   affected code is somewhat complex, but once you understand
         the design, not particularly difficult to understand
    ***  affected code uses a special, exceptionally tricky design
 - algo = difficulty of the new algorithm to be written
    *    the required logic and code is straightforward
    **   the required logic is somewhat complex and needs a careful design
    ***  the required logic is exceptionally tricky,
         maybe an approach to solve that is not even known yet
 - size = the amount of code to be written or changed
    *    a small number of lines (at most 100, usually much less)
    **   a considerable amount of code (several dozen to a few hundred)
    ***  a large amount of code (many hundreds, maybe thousands)
 - imp = importance of the issue
    *    mostly for completeness
    **   would be nice to have
    ***  issue causes considerable inconvenience

Obviously, as the issues have not been solved yet, these annotations
are mere guesses, and some may be wrong.

- The abort() in bufcat(), html.c, can be triggered via buffmt_includes()
  by running -Thtml -Oincludes on a file containing a long .In argument.
  Fixing this will probably require reworking the whole bufcat() concept.

- \\ in high-level macro arguments
  Currently, \\ is expanded in two situations:
  1) macro and string definition (roff.c setstrn())
  2) macro argument parsing (mandoc.c mandoc_getarg())
  For user defined macros, the second happens in time because of ROFF_REPARSE.
  But for standard high-level macros, it only happens after entering the
  high level parsers, which is too late because the code doesn't get
  back to roff.c roff_res() from that point.  Because this requires
  distinguishing requests, user-defined macros and standard macros
  on the roff_res() level, it is hard to solve without the parser reorg.

- inside `.Bl -column' phrases, punctuation is handled like normal
  text, e.g. `.Bl -column .It Fl x . Ta ...' should give "-x -."

- inside `.Bl -column' phrases, TERMP_IGNDELIM handling by `Pf'
  is not safe, e.g. `.Bl -column .It Pf a b .' gives "ab."
  but should give "ab ."

- check whether it is correct that `D1' uses INDENT+1;
  does it need its own constant?
  loc *  exist **  algo **  size *  imp **

- prohibit `Nm' from having non-text HEAD children
  (e.g., NetBSD mDNSShared/dns-sd.1)
  (mdoc_html.c and mdoc_term.c `Nm' handlers can be slightly simplified)

- support translated section names
  e.g. x11/scrotwm scrotwm_es.1:21:2: error: NAME section must be first
  that one uses NOMBRE because it is spanish...
  deraadt tends to think that section-dependent macro behaviour
  is a bad idea in the first place, so this may be irrelevant
  loc **  exist **  algo **  size *  imp **

- When there is free text in the SYNOPSIS and that free text contains
  the .Nm macro, groff somehow understands to treat the .Nm as an in-line
  macro, while mandoc treats it as a block macro and breaks the line.
  No idea how the logic for distinguishing in-line and block instances
  should be, needs investigation.

  loc *  exist ***  algo ***  size *  imp **

- .%T can have trailing punctuation.  Currently, it puts the trailing
  punctuation into a trailing MDOC_TEXT element inside its own scope.
  That element should rather be outside its scope, such that the
  punctuation does not get underlines.  This is not trivial to
  implement because .%T then needs some features of in_line_eoln() -
  slurp all arguments into one single text element - and one feature
  of in_line() - put trailing punctuation out of scope.
  Found in mount_nfs(8) and exports(5), search for "Appendix".
  loc **  exist **  algo ***  size *  imp **

- Trailing punctuation after .%T triggers EOS spacing, at least
  outside .Rs (eek!).  Simply setting ARGSFL_DELIM for .%T is not
  the right solution, it sends mandoc into an endless loop.

Several areas can be cleaned up to make mandoc even faster.  These are

- improve hashing mechanism for macros (quite important: performance)

- improve hashing mechanism for characters (not as important)

- the PDF file is HUGE: this can be reduced by using relative offsets

- instead of re-initialising the roff predefined-strings set before each
  parse, create a read-only version the first time and copy it
  loc *  exist **  algo **  size *  imp **

************************************************************************

************************************************************************

- Use libz directly instead of forking gunzip(1).
  Suggested by bapt at FreeBSD among others.

- We use the input line number at several places to distinguish
  same-line from different-line input.  That plainly doesn't work
  with user-defined macros, leading to random breakage.

- Find better ways to prevent endless loops
  in roff(7) macro and string expansion.

- Finish cleanup of date handling.
  Decide which formats should be recognized where.
  Update both mdoc(7) and man(7) documentation.

@Re-write of eqn(7) parser and MathML output.
This adds parser-level support for the grammar described by the eqn
second-edition technical paper, "Typesetting Mathematics — User's Guide"
(Kernighan, Cherry).
The reason for this re-write is the grouping rules, which were not
possible given the existing implementation.
The re-write has also considerably simplified the HTML (and, if it ever
is completed, terminal) front-end.

  If the file name of a page does not agree with the contents of any

  If there is a page with a file name that does not appear as a substring

  .cc |

@Fix an assertion failure raised by the following interesting scenario: a

leading spaces in the line triggering assertion when searching for

This led to a fix giving a nice performance speed-ups (a few percent,
with some quick trials): the search for flags immediately exits if the
macro has no flags, instead of having to first parse the leading word
then look it up.  I also cleaned up the argv parsing stuff a little bit
and added more documentation.

- In man(7), an empty subsection (.SS) should not be an error, probably
  not even a warning.  For example, in ExtUtils::CChecker(3p), this is
  used in a way similar to empty .It -tag in mdoc(7), that is, explaining
  two commands (both presented with .SS markup) in one paragraph of text.

- another example of the same problem:

@

@Allow string lengths to account for escapes.  Now all calls to calculate
column width in -Tascii, -Tpdf, and -Tps will account for "more real"
string lengths.

Example:

.Bl -tag -width \s[+123424]foo
.It bar

.El

The size escape will be correctly tossed.

.Bl -tag -width \(aqbar
