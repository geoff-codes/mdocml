log
@Improve build system and autodetection.
* Make ./configure standalone, that's what people expect.
* Let people write a ./configure.local from scratch, not edit existing files.
* Autodetect wchar, sqlite3, and manpath and act accordingly.
* Autodetect the need for -L/usr/local/lib and -lutil.
* Get rid of config.h.p{re,ost}, let ./configure only write what's needed.
* Let ./configure write a Makefile.local snippet, that's quite flexible.

@Get rid of HAVE_CONFIG_H, it is always defined; idea from libnbcompat.
Include <sys/types.h> where needed, it does not belong in config.h.
Remove <stdio.h> from config.h; if it is missing somewhere, it should
be added, but i cannot find a *.c file where it is missing.
