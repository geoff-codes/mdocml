@In private header files, __BEGIN_DECLS and __END_DECLS are pointless.
Because these work slightly differently on different systems,
they are becoming a maintenance burden in the portable version,
so delete them.

Besides, one of the chief design goals of the mandoc toolbox is to
make sure that nothing related to documentation requires C++.
Consequently, linking mandoc against any kind of C++ program would
defeat the purpose and is not supported.
I don't understand why kristaps@@ added them in the first place.

@Reduce the amount of code by moving the three copies of the ohash
callback functions into one common place, preparing for the use of
ohash for some additional purposes.  No functional change.
